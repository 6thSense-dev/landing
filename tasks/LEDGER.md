# Task ledger

## 2026-08-04 — Conference mobile conversion audit

- Audited the production React source and rendered mobile experience for the AI4 conference referral use case.
- Added `tasks/SITE-AUDIT.md` with the current claim inventory, defensibility assessment, Eye1/prohibited-claim sweep, brand-mark mismatch, mobile-first findings, weakest first-screen issue, and ten ranked fixes with effort estimates.
- Found conference blockers: Eye2 is not the first-screen offer; a 3.8-second opener delays first paint; the contact path is at the end of an approximately 9.4-screen mobile journey; live/legacy/prerendered routes publish claims beyond Eye2 at 30 fps; and public routes offer Skin/Hand despite the Eye2-only constraint.
- Made no site or style changes; this task was audit-only and safe claim cleanup spans several coupled routes.
- Verification: `npm ci`; `npm run build` (passed); headless Chromium checks of `/` and `/products` at 390px.

## 2026-09-03 — Catalog and processed storage tiers

- Routed bundle-relative `media/` assets to the configured processed-package bucket and prefix while retaining catalog documents and previews on the catalog tier.
- Added a package-file refusal guard to the catalog preview uploader, rollout documentation, and routing/presigning tests.
- Verification and mutation evidence: `tasks/CATALOG-TIER-BUCKETS-2026-09-03.md`.
